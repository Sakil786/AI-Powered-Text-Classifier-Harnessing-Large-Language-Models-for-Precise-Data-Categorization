But thats not why I gave it such a crappy rating. The reason is really some of the dialogue is childish and unrealistic and mostly sounds forced. A lot of the special effects really got on my nerves and I dont care what year this movie was made in. Look at The Day The Earth Stood Still. 1950's, still excellent top-notch effects.

I did not believe it, I thought most electronic games were basically the same. BOY WAS I WRONG!! It took me some time to learn how to play the game correctly. If you have never played Slingo before read the instruction sheet, this is one game you cannot learn just by playing with it. Once I got going it was hard for me to stop, I kept telling myself just one more game, one more! You get points by filling up the spaces on a numerical bingo card; by matching the Numbers, getting Jokers, and if you are lucky Gold Coins. You can also get Free Spins these will help you at the end of the game. Beware, with every spin you take you risk loosing half of your points to a Sneaky Little Devil with a nasty laugh. I know he is not real but sometimes I would like to reach in and strangle him. If you are very lucky and fill up all of the available spaces you get a SLINGO and bonus points. Slingo is both frustrating (the Devil) and exhilarating (getting a Slingo) it also teaches stradegy, just which number do want to pick with a Joker the right pick can make all the difference. The game has several nice features it has automatic shut off, nice sound effects that are not too loud, a mute button if you want to use it, and it keeps track of your 5 highest scores to give you something to shoot for. The only feature that I did not like was the spin numbers and symbols (Joker, Free Spin, Gold Coin, Devil) that appear at the bottom of each row, these are the numbers and symbols that you use to match those on the screen.

Whether someone is doing his/her best impersonation of Marlon Brando in his Godfather role, is desperately trying to protect the not-so-lucky &quot;Lucky&quot; Lucziano or is randomly penalizing others for imagined slights to his/her Moran Gang, it's always a blast. Here you'll find a constant barrage of contracts to exterminate your enemies, a healthy dose of backstabbing and a good sampling of weaseling out the very quiet but very powerful player. It's not really a game for your dates...unless neither of you mind having contracts placed on your hide by the other. Overall, the game is fast-paced, well-designed and just plain fun. I would recommend it to any group of semi-mature individuals bent on vengeance against one another.",toys games,games,card games,card,False

Anyway, my daughter loved playing with it so much that I decided to keep it.Today, I just brought it out to show my twins - they were enthralled!

This new house is made to last, if carefully played with, and unlike its earlier vinyl counterparts, could be stored and still look like new years from now. In keeping with the history of this product, the size is modest offering limited defined play area within the house, but, presents a space saving alternative to the &quot;full-sized&quot; Barbie houses and is quickly and easily folded up and moved. It's a little shy on colored decorating decals, and the kitchen/dining table is really too small to seat two dolls at with plates and utensils. It's perfect if Barbie is a single mother with a little Kelly or Tommy to raise in the house as she/he gets their own swing around high chair built onto the table (removable.) Also, uniquely, this house's litte built-in kitchen comes with a refrigerator, something neither the Folding Pretty House of 1997 nor the Fold N' Fun House of the late 80's could say. Unfortunately, as always, the scale is too small to accommodate the slightly larger Ken dolls comfortably, and, while the house has some neat features, the built-in computer is useless as there is no way to get Barbie's legs out of the way so she can actually get to, sit in front of and use the keyboard. Some folks might be relieved at the house's unusual (for Barbie) blue and cream colors. I think Mattel should have brought it out two available colors, the other being Barbie pink and cream. There's a lot to be said for consistency, especially to collectors who might find themselves uncomfortable with the blue house displayed among all the normal pink houses, accessories and dresses. We like it, accepting it for the product it is and appreciating its quality of design and manufacture.
